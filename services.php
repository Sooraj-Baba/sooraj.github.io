                            the people.
                            If we think that why the price of the online products are less than the market price, it is
                            because the market price is included with various taxes like: vat, service tax and so on
                            whereas the online shopping provides the services direct to the customer without the help of
                            the third person in the market. This is the reason why the market rice is more than the
                            online price.

                            That is the reason why the most of the people prefer today to do online shopping rather than
                            going to the market. There are many online companies like: ebay where you can get the huge
                            discounts on the products. Ebay India Offers the huge and wide range in the different
                            products whether it is electronics, grocery, furniture, clothing and so on.</i>
